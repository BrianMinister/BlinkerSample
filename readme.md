#Blinker for Netduino#

This is an example of innefficient use of hardware to do simple things in software.

A seven segment display can be driven by 3 wires + ground. An array of LEDs can be driven at 2 to 1 ratio for ports to LEDs.

I just didn't want to spend the time to do that. I was just goofing off with the hardware.
